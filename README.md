# PyOCR
Personal OCR tools using Tesseract and Python

## Functions
Grab the image on clipboard and output the OCR result back to the clipboard

## How to use
I'm only talking about the case of windows users:
Make sure you have had [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and Python installed on your computer.
pip install the libraries imported in the script.
Take a screenshot, run one of these scripts, and you should see the output on your clipboard.
I wrote 2 versions of this tool that allow you either to specify the target language yourself or to have the program detect it automatically.
